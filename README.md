# Fanta NBA predictor

This is a project that aims to be a useful helper with fantasy nba games. There is a lot of WIP scripts and ideas, but the main concept is to collect data about nba players/team statistics from different sources and combine them together in order to compute a score for each player in the fantasy game.

Then, there is an optimization task where the algorithm tries to find the best combination of players and coach, based on score and cost.
