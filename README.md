# Fanta NBA predictor

This is a project that aims to be a useful helper with fantasy nba games. There are a lot of WIP scripts and ideas, but the main concept is to collect data about nba players/team statistics from different sources and combine them together in order to compute a score for each player in the fantasy game.

Then, there is an optimization task in a 0/1 knapsack problem fashion, where the algorithm tries to find the best combination of players and coach, based on score and cost.
